    <h1 style="background-color: yellow; font-size: larger; color: rgb(22, 196, 45); font-family: Arial; font-size: 40px;">What is Global Warming?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Global warming is the gradual increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to effects such as more frequent and severe heatwaves, rising sea levels due to melting ice caps, and disruptions to ecosystems. The consequences of global warming include significant impacts on human health, economic stability, and natural environments, necessitating urgent action to reduce emissions and adapt to changing conditions.</p>

    <h1 style="background-color: yellow; font-size: larger; color: rgb(22, 196, 45); font-family: Arial; font-size: 40px;">What are the Main Reasons for It?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The main reasons for global warming are:
        <br>Burning of Fossil Fuels: The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
        <br>Deforestation: Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO₂, thereby increasing the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere.
        <br>Industrial Activities: Manufacturing and other industrial processes emit greenhouse gases, including CO₂, methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), contributing significantly to global warming.
        <br>Agricultural Practices: Livestock farming produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas, while certain farming techniques release nitrous oxide, another significant greenhouse gas.
        <br>Waste Management: Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen), contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
        <br><br>These activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.

    <h1 style="background-color: yellow; font-size: larger; color: rgb(22, 196, 45); font-family: Arial; font-size: 40px;">What Should We Do to Stop or Reduce Global Warming?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">To stop or reduce global warming, we need to transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, increase energy efficiency in buildings and vehicles, and promote reforestation. Sustainable agricultural practices and waste reduction are also crucial. Supporting public transportation, adopting electric vehicles, and implementing carbon pricing can further reduce emissions. Additionally, promoting climate-friendly policies, raising public awareness, and investing in green technologies will help mitigate global warming. These combined efforts can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and limit the impact of global warming.</p>
